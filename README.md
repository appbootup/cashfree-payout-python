#  Cashfree Python Integration 

Python bindings for interacting with the Cashfree API. This is useful for merchants who are looking to automate their bank transfers programatically. 

# Using 

As you can see there are two files. "Execute.py" is a guide to calling the API.
NOTE : Ensure that "execute.py" and "cfPayout.py" are in the same folder.

# Setting Up

You will need to authenticate client by calling the clientAuth function as follows : 

```python
from cfPayout import cashfreeUser

user1 = cashfreeUser()
user1.clientAuth('dummyClientId','dummyClientSecret',"TEST/PROD"

```
